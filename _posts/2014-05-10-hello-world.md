title: On the subject of first posts
---

This blog is far from my first blog, and as such this post is far from my first blog post. I must say I've lost count of how many blogs I've made in the past, but I do recall that with each of them I tried to make a commitment to post regularly and actually _stick_ with the blog, but alas here I am, with yet another blog, clearly violating all those commitments.

So let me tell you a story of how I ended up writing this so-called first post, and why I chose to run it on Jekyll and GitHub Pages, as opposed to the plethora of beautiful GUI-based tools available. But first of all, let me introduce myself.

My name is Andhika Nugraha. I am a final-year Computer Science student at Institut Teknologi Bandung, Indonesia, but currently I'm on the Erasmus Mundus LOTUS student mobility programme to the University of Kent in the UK.

...or so I would speak of myself in the first paragraph of a job application cover letter.

A couple of weeks ago, my [wonderful girlfriend](http://alectronafelidae.wordpress.com) and I had a conversation about personal branding (otherwise known as Twitter bios, ha.), and she'd come up with two words to describe herself: _knowledge enthusiast_. The phrase fit her perfectly, and if you'd had the fortune of getting to know her, even for a brief moment, you'd agree with me.

The question then was: _what would my Twitter bio be?_

For the past couple of years I've tried out doing a couple of different things. For the last two years I've been quite active in organising events at my university, but I also joined Model UN. Although I haven't been competing much lately, I was also an active debater and to this day I recognise debating as one of the 'biggest things' that's shaped my personality. I also volunteer at Bina Antarbudaya, and I've always felt at home there.

But I finally realised that my core passion was in coding. I've always been fascinated with code, particularly the web, ever since I first touched Microsoft FrontPage during a vacation care programme in Melbourne 13 years ago. Looking back, to be honest I haven't developed as many sites and apps as I'd like, but I figured I could always start again now. What better way to make that point than make a new blog on Jekyll and GitHub? For now I'm settling with using [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) but I'm definitely going to properly design this place later on.

Admittedly, however, it's been a couple of weeks since I actually found that answer. What finally got me to actually `git commit` and publish this site was a [short but eloquent post](http://afuta.me/2014/05/04/a-short-account-on-humility/) by the brilliant [Andhyta Firselly Utami](http://afuta.me/):

> Yes, thereâ€™s a fine line between confidence and arrogance, but a trained mind can tell when they see one. So worry not: dare yourself to tell the world what you love and/or good at. Just keep your apology for the rainy days when you have to hurt someone for what you believe in. And when that time comes, tell yourself that things are going to be alright.

Having said that: Hello, world!
